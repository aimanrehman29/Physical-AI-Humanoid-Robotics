# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — Essentials

This textbook introduces Physical AI with a humanoid focus. You’ll learn the core anatomy, ROS 2 basics, simulation with Gazebo/Isaac, vision-language-action loops, and a capstone pipeline that ties it all together. Built with Docusaurus (MDX-first); a RAG chatbot may be added later for contextual Q&A.

## What’s inside

- **Chapters 1–6**: Introduction to Physical AI, humanoid basics, ROS 2 fundamentals, digital twin simulation, vision-language-action, and a capstone project.  
- **Capstone**: Build a simple AI-robot pipeline in simulation: perceive → plan → act with safety checks.  
- **Content ops**: Spec-Kit Plus templates and style guidance to keep chapters consistent and reviewable.

## How to use this site

- Browse chapters from the sidebar; start with **Introduction to Physical AI** if you are new to humanoid robotics.
- Copy runnable snippets (Python) and diagrams; each chapter ends with a checklist and “pitfalls to avoid.”
- Track upcoming work in the Capstone and Content Ops pages; they outline what will land next.
